**originalityStatement.txt:** Text file which includes the statement certifying the work as my own. The project was built upon the unfinished version of 7 Wonders Duel, forked from the Github (https://github.com/ygoduelistharry/7-wonders-duel) on the 20.02.2023. This was also credited in the project report with a description of the game state at the time it was forked as well as a list of all the features added, and changes made. The code of the initial game can still be found at: old_custom_environment/forked_seven_wonders_duel.py with the old adjusted environment at: old_custom_environment/seven_wonders_duel.py and the new redesigned game environment at: WondersDuelEnv.py.
